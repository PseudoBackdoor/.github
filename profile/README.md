# PseudoBackdoor

"Backdoor" is just the front door with a sign that says "Secret Entrance" in Comic Sans.

While real backdoors are often malicious, hidden entry points into systems, PseudoBackdoor presents itself as a front-facing, transparent entity that's all about openness and community benefit.

At PseudoBackdoor, collaborators come together to work on projects that serve a dual purpose. 

On one hand, we develop initiatives aimed at benefiting the community; this involves  creating open-source software tools.

On the other hand, we take on outsourced projects from external clients allowing the organization to maintain financial sustainability while providing business value.

We put the '**pseudo**' in code and the '**backdoor**' in... well, just about everything else.
